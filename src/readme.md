Send Replies to messages received trough 'Contact Form 7' and stored with 'Flamingo'.  

== Description ==

In case you are using both 'Contact Form 7' and 'Flamingo', with Bonaire you can send Replies to messages you received trough a CF7 form and have stored with 'Flamingo'. In addition, Bonaire let's you store your replies in your mail server's "Sent Items" folder. Never lose track of a conversation! Supports one contact form per website (for now).

== Features ==

- Send replies to messages
- Store replies on your mail server's 'Sent Items' folder
- Dashboard Widget

== Requirements ==

- A 'Contact Form 7' contact form.
- 'Flamingo' needs to be installed and activated.

PHP version 5.6 or above.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `bonaire` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the "Bonaire" plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I interact with this plugin and how does it work? =

Please visit the plugin help tab for further information.

= Why doesn't it show up in the settings menu? =

Most likely, this is because you didn't install and activate the plugins Bonaire was made for, namely 'Contact Form 7' and 'Flamingo'.
After installing and activating these two plugins, Bonaire will show up on in the settings menu.

= I have the two plugins installed and activated but it doesn't work! =

That's unlikely.
First of all, you have to enter the email account settings for the email account that you use on the contact form. You can do that on the settings page "Settings -> Bonaire".
If you want to store your replies in your mail server's "Sent Items" folder, you have to enter your IMAP settings, and maybe activate the 'nocert' option, too.

= Are there any known limitations? =

- There is no support for attachments (yet)

= Can you help me? =

Yes. I have a look at the plugin's support page two or three times a month and I provide some basic support there.

= Are there any known issues? =

- No
